By installing, copying, or otherwise using the Application, you ("the User") agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth below. If you do not agree, please do not use the Application.

**1. Service Description**

P2Lan Transfer is a cross-platform application that allows users to transfer files and send messages directly to other devices on the same local area network (LAN) using a peer-to-peer method. The Application does not require a central server and operates entirely on the user's devices.

**2. Acceptance of Terms**

By using the Application, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to comply with all of these terms.

**3. User Rights and Responsibilities**

    *   Transmit any content that is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, infringing, or morally objectionable.
    *   Share malware, viruses, trojans, or any other malicious code.
    *   Violate the intellectual property rights (copyright, trademark) of any third party.

**4. User Content and Developer's Disclaimer of Liability**

*   **Client-Side Operation:** P2Lan Transfer is a fully client-side application. All file transfers and messaging activities occur directly between the users' devices on the LAN.
*   **No Data Collection:** We, the developers of P2Lan Transfer, **do not collect, store, or access any personal data or content** (including files, messages, or chat history) transmitted through the Application. Transfer and chat history data is stored locally on your device using the Isar database and is only accessible by you.

*   The User is responsible for selecting and configuring the security options that suit their needs.
*   The developer is not responsible for any data loss or security breaches arising from the user's choice of an inappropriate security configuration (e.g., selecting "no encryption" in an insecure network environment).

The Application is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis without any warranty of any kind, whether express or implied. The developer does not warrant that the Application will be error-free, operate without interruption, or meet all of your requirements.

**7. Limitation of Liability**

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developer shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages (including loss of data, business interruption, or device damage) arising out of the use or inability to use the Application.
